# Selecting the Optimal Fantasy Premier League Squad with Linear Programming

The goal of this project to build the optimal Fantasy League squad given the following constraints:
- budget is 100M
- max 3 players from the same team
- exactly 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 strikers

Optimal team definition:
1) Dream Team - Most points
2) Money Team - Highest ROI (Total points per Fantasy dollars spent)

Process:
1) Downloading the the most up-to-date player stats from a website built on Fantasy Premier League API
2) Running EDA on teams and players
3) Build optimal team with Linear Programming
